This means you don't have to declare `@import 'jeet'` anywhere and you'll still get Jeet functionality everywhere. If, for some reason, this doesn't suit your fancy, and you like `@import`ing stuff, you can explicitly disable this functionality by modifying the above line:\n\n```js\n.use(jeet({ implicit: false }));\n```\n\n####Syntax Quick Reference\n[https://github.com/mojotech/jeet/blob/master/jeet/index.styl](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet/blob/master/jeet/index.styl)\n\n####HTML Boilerplate\n[https://github.com/mojotech/jeet-html](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet-html)\n\n####Roots Integration\n[https://github.com/mojotech/jeet-roots](https://github.com/mojotech/jeet-roots)\n\n####Help! npm is throwing permission errors!\nYou're probably trying to `sudo` everything aren't you? That's bad juju! `sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local` will fix this. You might be interested in reinstalling all your global npm packages without sudo as well. Don't believe us? Here's a [blog post](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm) on the subject by the maintainer of npm himself.\n\n####License\nJeet is licensed under [GPL Version 3](http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0)\n",
