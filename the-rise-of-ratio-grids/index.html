        <h1>The Rise of Ratio Grid Systems</h1>
        <p>
          A farewell to traditional CSS grid systems
        </p>
        <p>
          Cory Simmons - <a href="https://twitter.com/ccccory">@ccccory</a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Why I got into ratio grids</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Cory. I've been a freelance web-designer for several years. In that time I had a client for a few years that was... "picky" and indecisive.
        </p>
        <p>
          He'd want a website with 3 columns, then he'd want to add another column, then another, then remove one, then add 3 more, then...... you get the picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I needed a way to quickly appease him. I needed a more powerful grid system...
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>But first, what is a traditional CSS grid?</h2>
        <p>
          Any grid distributed as pure CSS.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>The Big Ones</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>960.gs</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
          <li>Foundation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Pros and Cons of pure CSS grids?</h2>
        <h4>Pros</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Target a much wider audience</li>
          <li>Easy to package for various tools like Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cons</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Almost everyone uses a preprocessor nowadays</li>
          <li>Not as powerful</li>
          <li>More markup</li>
          <li>It's not that hard to use a preprocessor with tools like Rails, in fact, it's built in</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>CSS grids suck</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>More markup in the form of <code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;</code>'s</li>
          <li>Big CSS filesizes</li>
          <li>More classes, god the classes *</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          * I know what OOCSS is. It still looks like markup spaghetti and is overkill for most sites. Not to mention, you don't have to forfeit OOCSS for preprocessor solutions
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>An actual example straight from the docs</h2>
        <p>
          Bootstrap<br>
          <code>&lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-6 col-md-5 col-md-offset-2 col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-0&quot;&gt;</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Foundation<br>
          <code>&lt;div class=&quot;small-5 small-push-7 medium-7 medium-push-5 columns&quot;&gt;</code>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>"But Bootstrap and Foundation offer semantic mixins for their grids"</h2>
        <p>
          After some editing and copying &amp; pasting you can use Bootstrap's mixins for your grids, but they're still not very flexible (you have to make a new mixin every time you want to change the number of grid columns).
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed Foundation offers a great little Sass-based grid toolkit that mimics Bourbon Neat. It's not as flexible as some of the ratio grids out there, but kudos to the Foundation team.
        </p>

        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Up your grid game</h2>
        <p>
          Grids are the most important part of any UI toolkit. They offer a way to lay out your entire website in a neat way and we use them on every single site we ever build.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why aren't we making it a point to spend some time exploring grid systems?
        </p>
        <p>
          If any part of our workflow deserves special attention, it's grids.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Truly flexibility</h2>
        <p>
          What if we could define our grids on the fly? What if we didn't need <code>.row</code> classes anymore?
        </p>
        <p>
          What would our markup look like?
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>A ratio grid called Jeet</h2>
        <p>
          Jeet is a grid system that works with Sass or Stylus.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h3>Traditional Bootstrap Markup</h3>
<pre class="hljs html"><code>&#x3C;div class=&#x22;row gallery&#x22;&#x3E;
  &#x3C;div class=&#x22;col-xs-6 col-md-4&#x22;&#x3E;item&#x3C;/div&#x3E;
  &#x3C;div class=&#x22;col-xs-6 col-md-4&#x22;&#x3E;item&#x3C;/div&#x3E;
&#x3C;/div&#x3E;
</code></pre>
        <h3>Jeet Markup</h3>
<pre class="hljs html"><code>&#x3C;section class=&#x22;gallery&#x22;&#x3E;
  &#x3C;div&#x3E;item&#x3C;/div&#x3E;
  &#x3C;div&#x3E;item&#x3C;/div&#x3E;
&#x3C;/section&#x3E;
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Jeet Style</h2>
<pre class="hljs css"><code>.gallery
  cf()
  > div
    col(1/2)
    +above(medium)
      col(1/3)
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>Flexibility</h2>
        <p>
          Let's say we want our grid to be a row of 4 items. It's as easy as changing one value.
        </p>
<pre class="hljs css"><code>.gallery
  cf()
  > div
    col(1/4)
</code></pre>
        <p>
          In traditional CSS grids we'd have to go back over every instance of that class in our markup and replace it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>That's not all!</h2>
        <p>
          Let's say we have a 3 column grid at the top of our page for something like a masthead, and somewhere below that we need a 5 column grid for something like services.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: center">
          <img src="img/3-5-grid.jpg" height="200px">
        </div>
        <p>
          There's no way to do this with traditional CSS grids without upping the original amount of columns to 15 - which will screw up all your existing markup.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>With a ratio grid...</h2>
<pre class="hljs css"><code>.masthead
  cf()
  > div
    col(1/3)

.services
  cf()
  > div
    col(1/5)
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>But wait, there's more! Padding-based grids are icky</h2>
        <p>
          Bootstrap and Foundation use padding-based columns. This is a grid solution where you can drop in as many elements as you'd like and they adhere to the grid beautifully. The downside is, you don't have real empty space between elements. It's all padding. This means if you want to change the background for elements in your grid, you need to create a new element inside every single column you'd like to have it's own background color - you can't just change the column's background color.
        </p>
        <p>
          Foundation tries to cheat with their "Block Grid", but if you change the actual column elements (the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s) it still paints the entire column's background so you still need to nest an element inside of it.
        </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>In their defense</h2>
        <p>
          These <b>are</b> the best grids you can make with CSS only *, and they <b>are</b> trying to market their frameworks to the biggest possible audience. So it makes sense for padding-based CSS only grids to exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          * <i>cough</i> Flexbox <i>cough</i>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="step">
        <h2>We're not babies</h2>
        <p>
          CSS-only grids will always exist to cater to people who don't use preprocessors, but maybe we should take our grid-destiny in our own hands and simply swap out their grids for preprocessor based ones.

        <h4>Sidenote</h4>
        <p>
          Literally every single developer I've ever worked with on a project has used Bootstrap and has screwed up the grid markup. And every single designer who has switched from traditional CSS grids to ratio grids has been really happy with the switch.
